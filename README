# Cmake Files for 3dfx Win2k/XP V3/V4/V5 Driver

With the help of these CMake files, you should be able to build the 3dfx drivers - minor code changes are needed.
The 3dfx driver source code is not included.

I was able to build the driver on Windows 10 using:
- Windows DDK for WinXP
- DX81SDK
- several patches to the driver source code to get it to compile.

Using that, the driver can be compiled, but it doesn't work. I never invested the time to debug it.

# Code Changes needed to the original Driver Code

- Several API calls need an APIENTRY added after the return type.
- several headers don't have include guards, they need to be added.
